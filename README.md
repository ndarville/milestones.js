Why `milestones.js`?
--------------------
Communicating progress and current features under development in general, but particularly people without any awareness of GitHub can be difficult, as unknowing users keep clamouring for the very features that are currently under development.

Even Github’s [milestones][milestones] system has its shortcomings, because you have to go traverse a jungle of links and clicks on a GitHub project page to even get to them. This user experience relects a belief by the GitHub team that the milestones system is not something that should be given a high priority nor something that should be used by people regularly to follow the developments of a GitHub project. It is only something to be used internally by the project collaborators who already know the existence of the milestones feature.

But consider the benefits of being able to communicate the milestones to your ordinary user. Every software developer worth his or her salt wants to automate *everything*, and leveraging the [milestones API][api] can accomplish this, if developers use and update their milestones every now and then.
